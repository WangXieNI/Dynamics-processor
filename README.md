# NoiseGate effect
This is a noise gate effect demo. It contains the basic noise gate algorithm which references from the paper:
*Digital Dynamic Range Compressor Design——A Tutorial and Analysis*. By the way, audio file read/write methods are also involved.

## Usage
**NoiseGate User manual**  [中文版](https://github.com/jagger2048/NoiseGate/blob/master/NoiseGate%20User%20manual.md)

## To Do lists
- Advanced Noise Gate with Hysteresis function,based on the Dafx.
- Time-frequency based noise suppression algorithm,different from  the Time-domain level detectors based noise gate.
